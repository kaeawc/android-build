# JVM Args

# Specifies the JVM arguments used for the daemon process.
# The setting is particularly useful for tweaking memory settings.
 
# Specifies the JVM arguments used for the daemon process.
# The setting is particularly useful for tweaking memory settings.
# Ensure important default jvmargs aren't overwritten. See https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/19750
#
# For more information about how Gradle JVM options were chosen:
# - Xmx - Maximum heap size. If the codebase grew it should be updated.
# - Xms - Minimum heap size, we set it to the peak measured heap size.
# - UseG1GC - If the goal is to return as much memory as possible to the machine, G1GC is the better
#   choice. It is also very nearly as fast as ParallelGC.
# - Metaspace - See https://www.jasonpearson.dev/metaspace-in-jvm-builds/
# - SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB would default to 1000 which with a 4gb heap translates to ~51 minutes.
#   A value of 1 means ~4 seconds before SoftRefs can be collected, which means its realistic to
#   collect them as needed during a build that should take seconds to minutes.
# - CodeCache normally defaults to a very small size. Increasing it from platform defaults of 32-48m
#   because of how many classes can be loaded into memory and then cached as native compiled code
#   for a small speed boost.

# For more information about how Kotlin Daemon JVM options were chosen:
# - Kotlin JVM args only inherit Xmx, ReservedCodeCache, and MaxMetaspace. Since we are specifying
#   other args we need to specify all of them here.
# - We're using the Kotlin Gradle Plugin's default value for ReservedCodeCacheSize, if we do not then
#   the Gradle JVM arg value for ReservedCodeCacheSize will be used.

# Non-default Gradle performance settings

# system checks. As of early 2024 all known issues have been addressed and this should no longer be

# Before Gradle 8.4, some undeclared configuration inputs that were never used in the configuration
# logic could still be read when the task graph was serialized by the configuration cache. However,
# their changes would not invalidate the configuration cache afterward. Starting with Gradle 8.4,
# such undeclared configuration inputs are correctly tracked.
# As of 2/1/2024 AGP seems to have an undeclared configuration input based on Android SDK platform
# tool installation metadata, but this should never invalidate the configuration cache.
