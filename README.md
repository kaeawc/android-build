# Android Build Experiments

This is a repository for experimenting with Android Build options. Different providers, build tools, and
methods are used to showcase the different options available as well as best practices for
workflow and performance.

## JVM Args

### -XX:+UseG1GC

Every project's performance on G1GC vs ParallelGC seems to have slightly or significant characteristics. It is impossible to reliably test these algorithms with caching enabled due to the variances in network and IO bottlenecks, so I test these algorithms on clean builds with no caching. Android projects have a complicated memory footprint that can grow very quickly and as of JDK 17 most of the issues with G1GC have been fixed. This means that G1GC is the reliable option for returning memory and a good default for Android projects to stick with who aren't going to delve into JVM tuning. Also every JDK version since 17 has released iterations to improve upon G1GC to bring it closer and closer to Parallel's throughput performance levels. I still recommend testing GC algorithms on a case-by-case basis for JVM tuning.

### -Xmx and -Xms

Since we're on the [GitHub actions free tier we have roughly 16GB of memory available](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#standard-github-hosted-runners-for-public-repositories) in the worker. We therefore have plenty of resources available to us, but profiling shows we just don't use much in this build.

### -XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB=1

Read my article about [SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB in JVM Builds](https://www.jasonpearson.dev/softreflrupolicymspermb-in-jvm-builds/)

### No Metaspace Settings

Read my article about [Metaspace in JVM Builds](https://www.jasonpearson.dev/metaspace-in-jvm-builds/) for my reasoning and approach metaspace.

### -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize

CodeCache is where compiled native method and non-method code is cached in memory, see my article on [CodeCache for JVM Builds](https://www.jasonpearson.dev/codecache-in-jvm-builds/) for an in-depth dive about why its worth considering increasing it from platform defaults.. Since JVM 11 this has been split into 3 distinct parts for performance reasons, but most applications shouldn't be concerned with tuning those individually. Instead we want to ensure the CodeCache is allowed to grow without being forced to flush which speeds up the build time by A) not wasting time with excessive flushing and B) reuse compiled code. We could alternatively leave CodeCache to its defaults, however Kotlin Gradle Plugin would then set the Kotlin daemon's ReservedCodeCacheSize to 320m anyway (see my article on [Kotlin JVM arg Inheritance & Defaults](https://www.jasonpearson.dev/kotlin-jvm-args-inheritance-and-defaults/)).

### -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError

If your build does have an OOM and you want to analyze why it happened you're going to want the heap dump file. Of course you'd have to setup saving this file as a job artifact to make it accessible.

## Gradle Properties

TBD

## CI Setup

This project includes a comprehensive CI setup that showcases typical automated checks with a focus on speed. I use a fan-in approach for the commit workflow to quickly check and provide as much feedback as possible on the change being tested. This is not overly resource intensive due to the combination of caching every part of the Gradle build process possible (build cache, dependency cache, and configuration cache). I'm also showing how to easily integrate with Emulator.wtf which is currently the fastest and most reliable Android UI test platform.

Build APK: Generates an artifact for debug build that could be shared within a development team and dependency for UI test job.

Build Test APK: Dependency for UI test job, no artifact

Unit Tests: Regular Android JVM Unit tests

Spotless: Performs all configured Spotless plugin checks with ktfmt and spotless. This validates code format and ensures expected precommit checks have already been run.

Module Graph: Validates the module graph, checks that it adheres to the existing rules and limits the depth of the graph.

Android Lint: Runs an Android Lint check on the Release variant.

## Android Studio

[studio.vmoptions](studio.vmoptions): I've included a sample file in this repo with some decent options. Since this is not the only project I work on with Android Studio I set my heap size a bit higher, but otherwise it matches the Gradle & Kotlin Daemon JVM args.
